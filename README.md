## Course Overview
This course, STT 997: Advanced Topics in Statistics (Spring 2025) at Michigan State University, provides a comprehensive understanding of generative models and machine learning methods used to learn and synthesize complex, large-scale data. It aims to enhance the ability to implement these models across various applications, including temporal, multi-modal, and medical data scenarios. Topics covered include latent variable models, statistical distances, and model classes that approximate data distributions.

## Objectives
- Understand and implement generative models.
- Explore statistical principles and transitions in generative model literature.
- Gain hands-on experience with popular algorithms in Python and PyTorch.
